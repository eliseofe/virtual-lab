# Virtual Lab — Current Status

Updated: 18 September 2026

This file answers **where the project is now**. Development procedure lives in `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`; longer-term direction lives in `ROADMAP.md`; detailed technical/scientific contracts live in `docs/`.

## Current position

Virtual Lab is back in normal operations after the 17 September closed-loop recovery.

The frontend architecture migration to **Vite + React + TypeScript + Mantine** is complete. The current visual system is an accepted clean, functional baseline, not a permanently finished UI/UX endpoint.

The student self-registration and Getting started work is complete and production-verified. At least one real student has successfully registered, confirmed the account and signed in. The production Lab provides one normal student journey with self-registration/sign-in, Getting started/Help, and Grok/Claude connector guidance.

OAuth authorization for AI clients is hosted inside the production Virtual Lab artifact at `/oauth/consent/` and shares the normal Lab browser session. The former standalone mock-sim site is historical infrastructure and is not part of the active product path once Supabase Auth points at the production Lab authorization route.

The approved **#45 — Access, sharing, curation and Showcase** research-collaboration scope is complete through #287–#290 and is now a completed baseline. Professor accounts have automatic read-only supervision access to student/researcher Experiments; readable non-owned Experiments can be copied into an independent owned workspace; explicit ordinary sharing is read-only and revocable; student-to-student sharing is available for collaboration while redundant student-to-Professor sharing is excluded because Professor supervision already provides that access; Showcase remains a separate explicit curator action.

Assistant workspace discovery defaults to all Experiments visible through the authenticated user's existing RLS permissions. A Professor-connected research assistant can therefore discover and discuss supervised student/researcher Experiments before copying them; explicit `owned_only=true` still narrows discovery when desired.

The latest bounded **#273 — UI/UX refinement and visual polish from real use** pass is **#299 — Experiment navigation and Professor supervision UX**. Professor-supervised work now belongs to the Experiment library as a first-class read-only **Supervised** context alongside My experiments and Shared with me. The separate Student-experiments launcher/modal is removed from Professor/Account utilities. #273 remains a living evidence-driven domain and returns dormant after this bounded pass.

A new **#301 — Virtual Lab security, identity and authorization** umbrella is logged from real-student evidence. Its audit child **#302** is defined but not started; no enrollment, role, OAuth/client-admission or other remediation policy has been frozen.

## Immediate frontier

1. **#273 UI/UX** has no active child and is dormant/living after production-verified #299.
2. **#302 — security audit** is separately queued under new epic #301 but has not started; a later owner turn may select it.
3. Continue real student/owner scientific use and turn concrete evidence into focused fixes.
4. Studies and other parked/not-started lanes remain separately gated.

Do not invent a maintenance phase, a second Lab, another broad redesign, a duplicate collaboration mechanism, or an automatic successor to the completed #45 scope.

## Explicit gates and parked work

**Studies are not authorized yet.** Student onboarding, real student use, elapsed time, issue state or apparent technical readiness do not activate Studies. Only a later explicit owner instruction does.

Other parked/gated work includes:
- #285 Research submission snapshots — foundation exists, but there is no current distinct research use case; do not implement a submission workflow until the owner identifies one that is not already served by supervision visibility, sharing, copying or Showcase;
- deterministic RNG service implementation — requires explicit owner authorization;
- optional executable artifact dispatch — requires a concrete approved use case;
- numerical-integrator evaluation — requires owner scientific/numerical activation;
- native/HPC, richer physics/heterogeneous swarms, living environment/performance/validation umbrellas — future/on-demand.

## Production pointers

- Production Lab: https://eliseofe.github.io/virtual-lab/
- AI authorization UI: https://eliseofe.github.io/virtual-lab/oauth/consent/
- Hosting: GitHub Pages.
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript + Mantine.
- Scientific/runtime authority: Rust/WASM kernel plus worker/runtime/compiler modules.
- Registry/Auth/MCP backend: Supabase.
- Production MCP endpoint: `https://izdmmudfrmqhvlgepwes.supabase.co/functions/v1/experiment-mcp`.
- Runnable Experiment artifacts: Configuration, Initialization, Controller, Metrics; empty Metrics is valid.
- Results presentation state is separate from scientific Experiment revision state.

## Accepted storage direction

- Experiment = one runnable single-run scientific definition.
- Study = one named reproducible multi-run investigation, initially pinned to one exact Experiment revision.
- Standalone metric files live under `<Experiment>/runs/`.
- Study metric files live directly under `<Experiment>/studies/<Study>/`.
- There is no extra `runs/` directory inside a Study and no directory per simulation run.
- Raw scientific output remains local-first.

Scientific invariants and owner-authorized scientific definitions are maintained in `docs/SCIENTIFIC_CONTRACT.md` and the relevant technical contract documents, not duplicated here.

For the strategic map of major epics and whether they are unfinished, living, waiting for a use case, or not started, see `ROADMAP.md`.
